## 🌌 The Vision

**NovOS** is a cinematic, browser-based operating environment that redefines the relationship between the web and desktop computing. It is not merely a "skin" for a website — it is a fully integrated micro-kernel OS, complete with a POSIX-compliant virtual file system, security model, process lifecycle management, and a sophisticated event bus.

Our mission is to provide a distraction-free, high-fidelity workspace where developers and creators can manage their digital lives without ever leaving the browser tab.

> *"The future of computing is not on your disk, but in your mind. We are just building the interface."*

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

NovOS is built on the principle of **Isolation & Orchestration** — every subsystem operates independently and communicates through a central event bus.

### The Micro-Kernel Core

The kernel operates as the central arbiter of the system, written in highly optimized vanilla JavaScript to ensure zero overhead.

| Subsystem | Role |
|:---|:---|
| **Neural Event Bus** | Orchestrates 100+ system events, from file writes to battery state changes |
| **VFS Manager** | Manages the link between in-memory file trees and IndexedDB persistence |
| **Window Scheduler** | Controls focus, z-index, and rendering cycle of all active windows |
| **HAL** | Interfaces with browser-level APIs (WebAudio, Battery API, WebGL) for a consistent app interface |

### Architecture Topology

```
[ USER INTERFACE LAYER (Aether) ]
      |
      +-- Desktop Shell (Phase: Desktop)
      +-- Authentication Shell (Phase: Login)
      +-- Overlay Stack (Spotlight, Mission Control)
      |
[ STATE ORCHESTRATION LAYER ]
      |
      +-- User Store (Identity, Files, Credentials)
      +-- OS Store (Windows, Processes, Hardware State)
      |
[ KERNEL LAYER (window.kernel) ]
      |
      +-- FS:   Virtual File System Controller
      +-- PROC: Process & App Lifecycle Manager
      +-- EVT:  Neural Event Bus System
      +-- HAL:  Browser API Bridge
      |
[ PERSISTENCE LAYER ]
      |
      +-- POSIX Abstraction Interface
      +-- IndexedDB Storage (novos-vfs-db)
```

### The Virtual File System (VFS)

The VFS is a full POSIX-compliant implementation backed by **IndexedDB**.

- **True Persistence** — Unlike `localStorage`, IndexedDB survives browser refreshes and supports large structured data.
- **Path Resolution** — Supports absolute paths (`/etc/config`), relative paths (`../docs`), and home shortcuts (`~/Desktop`).
- **Permissions** — Every node carries a 10-character permission string (e.g., `drwxr-xr-x`) with owner/group assignment.
- **Integrity** — On every boot, the kernel runs a checksum pass across all mounted partitions.

### Security & AppLoader Sandbox

Applications are treated as signed system packages, not raw components.

1. **Registry** — All apps must be defined in `APP_REGISTRY` with dimensions, category, and permission scope.
2. **Verification** — During boot, cryptographic bundles in `/usr/apps/` are validated. Invalid signatures block the launch.
3. **Sandboxing** — Installed apps run in strict isolation and must explicitly request hardware access (Camera, Mic, Network).

## 🖥️ User Interface & Experience

### The Aether Design Language

Aether is the soul of NovOS — a design system optimized for modern high-resolution displays.

| Principle | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| **Layered Glassmorphism** | `backdrop-filter: blur(24px)` + `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` for cinematic depth |
| **Subtle Gradients** | Wide-gamut HSL colors to prevent banding in dark environments |
| **Motion Orchestration** | Framer Motion spring physics — natural, weighted animations |
| **Typography** | JetBrains Mono (terminal) + Inter Variable (UI) |

### Spotlight Search

Activated with `Ctrl + Space` — the fastest navigation tool in NovOS.

- **Fuzzy Search** — Find apps, files, and settings with minimal keystrokes.
- **AI Integration** — Ask Nova questions directly from the search bar.
- **Quick Actions** — Type `theme dark` / `theme light` to switch instantly.

### Mission Control & Workspaces

`Ctrl + Tab` activates a bird's-eye view of all open windows using a specialized non-overlapping layout algorithm. NovOS supports up to **10 virtual workspaces** — move windows between them via the overlay or with keyboard shortcuts.

### Cinematic Window Management

- **Snap Engine** — Windows snap to screen edges and quadrants with magnetic precision.
- **Physics Drag** — Spring-based window dragging that feels weighted and real.
- **PiP Support** — Pin any app to float above all other windows.
- **Global Close** — `Esc` dismisses overlays and returns focus to the desktop.

---

## 📦 Application Ecosystem

NovOS ships with a curated set of high-fidelity applications and a **Nexus App Store** with 400+ available packages.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status Codes:**
> - 🟢 **Installed** — Shipped with the current build.
> - 🔵 **Available** — Can be installed via Nexus Store.
> - 🟡 **Coming Soon** — Planned for a future kernel update.

## 🔐 Security, Identity & Authentication

NovOS implements a multi-layer security model inspired by real UNIX systems.

### Multi-User Environment

- **Root vs User** — Only users in the `root` group can modify system files in `/etc/` or bundles in `/usr/apps/`.
- **Identity Persistence** — Each user's desktop and filesystem are fully isolated.
- **POSIX Permissions** — Every VFS node carries a `drwxr-xr-x`-style permission string with owner/group assignment.

### Default Credentials

| User | Password | Role |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `operator` | `admin` | Root / System Administrator |
| `guest` | *(none)* | Standard User |

### Authentication Flow

```
[ Login Screen ] → [ Credential Hash Check ] → [ Session Hydration ]
       ↑                      |                         |
       |              [ Auth Failure ]           [ Desktop Init ]
       └──────────────────────┘
```

### API Reference (window.kernel)

#### Filesystem Subsystem

```javascript
const fs = window.kernel.fs;

// Write a file
await fs.writeFile('/home/operator/hello.txt', 'Hello NovOS');

// Read a file
const content = await fs.readFile('/home/operator/hello.txt');

// Check if a node exists
const exists = await fs.exists('/home/operator/hello.txt');

// List a directory
const entries = await fs.readDir('/home/operator/Documents');

// Remove a node
await fs.remove('/home/operator/hello.txt');
```

#### Process Subsystem

```javascript
const pm = window.kernel.process;

// Launch an application
const pid = pm.launch('terminal', { cwd: '/etc' });

// List all running processes
const procs = pm.list();

// Terminate a process
pm.terminate(pid);
```

#### Event Bus

```javascript
const bus = window.kernel.events;

// Subscribe to a kernel event
bus.on('fs:ready', () => console.log('VFS is online'));

// Emit a custom event
bus.emit('app:custom-event', { data: 'payload' });
```

### Adding a New App

1. Create your component in `assets/components/apps/MyApp.js`.
2. Register the app in `appRegistry.js`:

```javascript
myApp: {
  title: 'My App',
  icon: 'rocket',
  category: 'Utilities',
  w: 600,
  h: 400,
  permissions: []
}
```

3. Add a launcher to the dock or desktop in `osStore.js`.
4. Ensure the component responds to `Esc` for window close.
5. Use `--glass-material` and `--accent-cyan` tokens for styling.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: How do I perform a full factory reset?**  
Open the Terminal and run `rm -rf /`, then refresh the page. This wipes the virtual disk and triggers the default VFS re-population script.

**Q: Why do my apps close on page refresh?**  
By design — NovOS only persists your **filesystem** and **identity** across refreshes. Active processes are volatile and cleared to ensure a clean kernel environment.

**Q: Is my data safe if I clear my browser cache?**  
**No.** NovOS stores everything in **IndexedDB**. A "Clear Site Data" action will wipe your virtual disk. Use **File Manager → Export** to back up important files to your local machine.

**Q: An app window is running but invisible (off-screen)?**  
Open Mission Control (`Ctrl + Tab`), locate the window preview, and click it to re-center.

**Q: Terminal says "command not found" for basic commands?**  
Your `PATH` variable is unset. Run `/bin/ls` using the absolute path to verify the binary exists, then repair your `.bashrc`.

**Q: Login screen reappears after the correct password?**  
Clear browser cookies and ensure "Third-party storage" is allowed in your browser's site settings.

**Q: My VFS is slow or behaving strangely?**  
Open DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → `novos-vfs-db` → Delete Database. Then refresh.

## 📑 Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all visionary developers to help build the future of the browser-based OS.

1. **Fork the repo** and create a feature branch.
2. **Glass-First Design** — Every UI element must respect Aether transparency and blur tokens.
3. **Persistence Integrity** — Never perform a VFS action without proper IndexedDB error handling.
4. **Event-Driven Logic** — Prefer the Kernel Event Bus over direct component communication.
5. **Cinematic Motion** — All transitions must use spring-based physics (no linear easing).
6. **No Placeholders** — Never use Lorem Ipsum or placeholder images in PRs.
7. **Testing** — Ensure your app works across all workspaces and responds to `Esc` for close.
8. **Documentation** — Every PR must include an update to `var/log/development.log`.
9. **Security** — Never expose raw password hashes in logs or terminal output.
10. **Respect** — Honor the vision of a unified, cinematic browser-based experience.
